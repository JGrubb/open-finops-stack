# 🎯 Project Reboot: FOCUS-First Open FinOps Stack

## Summary
This issue documents the complete reboot of the open-finops-stack project with a FOCUS-first architecture. We're building the definitive open source alternative to expensive finops vendor tools through a public blog series that documents the entire development process.

## Background
The original codebase has been archived in `archive/pre-focus-reboot` branch. We're starting fresh with lessons learned and a clear architectural vision based on the FinOps Open Cost & Usage Specification (FOCUS).

## Goals
- **Kill vendor pricing models**: Build a free alternative to tools that charge 2-3% of cloud spend
- **FOCUS standardization**: Use FOCUS as the foundation for multi-cloud data architecture
- **Easy deployment**: Docker/Podman packaging for minimal technical barrier to entry
- **Complete platform**: Ingestion → transformation → visualization → deployment

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **DuckDB**: Data processing and transformation foundation
- **DLT**: Modern Python data pipeline framework
- **dbt**: Version-controlled FOCUS transformations
- **Metabase**: Pre-built dashboards and analytics
- **Podman/Docker**: Container-based deployment

## Implementation Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)
**Issue: #18 - AWS Pipeline Implementation**
- [x] Complete AWS CUR pipeline with v1/v2 support
- [x] Centralized DuckDB database architecture  
- [x] Comprehensive CLI interface
- [x] Robust testing framework with realistic sample data
- [x] Development documentation and setup guides

**Status:** Successfully imported actual AWS billing data (1,700+ rows), all tests passing

**Merged PRs:** #12, #13, #14, #15

### ✅ Phase 1.5: Core Infrastructure Enhancements (COMPLETED)
**Issues: #27, #28, #29, #30, #32**
- [x] DuckDB direct reading for 80%+ memory reduction
- [x] Enhanced CUR v2 support with S3 URI parsing
- [x] Column naming preservation (AWS category prefixes)
- [x] State tracking for intelligent deduplication
- [x] Multi-export support for CUR version migration

**Status:** Major performance improvements and production hardening complete

**Merged PRs:** #27, #28, #29, #30, #33

### 🔄 Phase 2: Container Runtime & Deployment Infrastructure (IN PROGRESS)
**Issue: #34 - Podman Deployment**
- [ ] Podman setup as Docker Desktop alternative
- [ ] Container-based deployment configuration
- [ ] One-command setup without licensing requirements
- [ ] Simple single VM production hosting guides

**Status:** Setting up Podman-based containerization for easier deployment

**Active Work:** feature/podman-deployment branch

### ⏳ Phase 3: Visualization & Analytics (PLANNED)
**Issues: #19, #22, #23, #24, #25**
- [ ] Metabase setup with DuckDB integration
- [ ] Pre-built FinOps dashboard templates (#22)
- [ ] Advanced analytics features (#23)
- [ ] Custom dashboard creation guides (#24)
- [ ] Multi-cloud dashboard templates (#25)

**Status:** Infrastructure ready, awaiting Phase 2 completion

### ⏳ Phase 4: Multi-Cloud Support (PLANNED)
**Issue: #20 - Azure & GCP Integration**
- [ ] Azure billing export integration
- [ ] GCP billing API integration  
- [ ] Unified FOCUS transformations
- [ ] Cross-cloud data validation

### ⏳ Phase 5: Production Features & Transformations (PLANNED)
**Issue: #21 - dbt & Production Hardening**
- [ ] dbt FOCUS transformation library
- [ ] Production deployment automation
- [ ] Cost allocation methodologies
- [ ] Enterprise features (RBAC, multi-tenancy)

## Current Status: PHASE 1.5 COMPLETE! 🎉

✅ **Foundation and core enhancements complete** - Production-ready AWS pipeline with:
- Real-world validation (7,288+ billing records processed)
- Both CUR v1 (CSV) and v2 (parquet) format support
- Intelligent state tracking prevents duplicate processing
- 80%+ memory reduction through DuckDB streaming
- Multi-export support enables CUR version migrations

🔄 **Phase 2 in progress** - Podman containerization (issue #34)

## Key Capabilities Delivered

### Pipeline Features
- **Unified Analytics**: Single view across all billing periods via `UNION BY NAME`
- **Performance**: 500k+ rows/minute processing speed with streaming
- **Schema Evolution**: Automatic handling of new AWS columns
- **State Management**: Only processes new/changed data
- **Multi-Export**: Run v1 and v2 exports side-by-side during migration
