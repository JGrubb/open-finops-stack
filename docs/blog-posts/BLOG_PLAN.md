## Writing Guidelines

1. **Show Working Code**: Every post should demonstrate real, working functionality
2. **Include Actual Output**: Show real command outputs and data samples
3. **Reference PRs**: Link to the actual PRs that implemented the functionality
4. **Problem-First**: Start with the problem being solved, then show the solution
5. **Production Focus**: Emphasize production readiness, not toy examples

## Publishing Schedule

Posts will be published on [The FinOperator](https://www.thefinoperator.com/) blog as each phase is completed. The goal is to maintain a regular cadence while ensuring each post represents substantial, working functionality.
